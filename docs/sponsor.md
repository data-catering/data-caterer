# Sponsor

To have access to all the features of Data Caterer, you can subscribe according to your situation. You will not be
charged by usage. As you continue to subscribe, you will have access to the latest version of Data Caterer as new
bug fixes and features get published.

This has been a passion project of mine where I have spent countless hours thinking of the idea, implementing, 
maintaining, documenting and updating it. I hope that it will help with developers and companies with their testing 
by saving time and effort, allowing you to focus on what is important. If you fall under this boat, please consider
sponsorship to allow me to further maintain and upgrade the solution. Any contributions are much appreciated.

Those who are wanting to use this project for open source applications, [please contact me](#contact) as I would be 
happy to contribute.

This is inspired by the [mkdocs-material project](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) that
[follows the same model](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/insiders/).
