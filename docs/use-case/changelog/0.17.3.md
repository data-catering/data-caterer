# 0.17.3

Deployed: 19-11-2025

Latest features and fixes for Data Caterer include fixing the connection details required to connect to JDBC resource via UI.

## Bugfix

- Add in `dbtable` as combination of `schema` and `table` from UI connection definition into step options.
- Add CORS headers to API endpoints to fix "Failed to fetch" errors when accessing UI from different hosts/networks.
- Build for macOS x86_64, linux arm64
- Fix the nightly links to downloads by pushing when main branch is updated instead of tag push.
- Fix the hostname resolution for the UI when running on a different machine than the API.
- Updated docker-action.sh to determine version based on branch and commit hash.
- Added conditional logic to publish to Maven only on the main branch.
- Modified build.yml to set version dynamically based on the branch, supporting feature and bugfix branches.
