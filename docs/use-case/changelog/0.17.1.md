# 0.17.1

Deployed: 26-10-2025

Latest features and fixes for Data Caterer include major performance optimizations for regex-based data generation, architectural improvements to the UI layer, and enhanced testing infrastructure.

## Performance Optimization

- **Fast Regex Generation Mode**: Convert common regex patterns to pure SQL expressions, avoiding UDF overhead and improving generation performance by ~5-6x for large datasets. Enable via `config.enableFastGeneration(true)` or `flags.enableFastGeneration = true`. [Docs](../../docs/generator/data-generator.md#regex-patterns)

- **Supported Patterns**: Character classes (`\d`, `[A-Z]`, `[0-9]`), quantifiers (`{n}`, `{m,n}`), alternations `(A|B|C)`, alphanumeric sets, custom character sets

- **Automatic Fallback**: Unsupported patterns (backreferences, lookaheads, etc.) automatically fall back to UDF-based generation for compatibility

- **Performance Benchmark**: 1M records with `ACC[0-9]{8}` pattern - Standard mode: ~45s, Fast mode: ~8s

## UI & Service Layer Architecture

- **Service Components**: New centralized services for connection management, YAML plan/task loading, and Spark DataFrame lifecycle management

- **Multi-Level Caching**: In-memory (LRU), file-backed, and resource-specific caching strategies for reduced I/O and faster plan/task lookups

- **HTTP Utilities**: Cache headers (ETags, Cache-Control), structured error responses, and request rate limiting

- **Resource Management**: Centralized Spark session lifecycle management with proper resource cleanup

## Testing Infrastructure

- **Performance Testing**: New `performanceTest` Gradle source set with benchmark tests for data generation and foreign key operations, automated benchmark execution and comparison scripts

- **Integration Testing**: Enhanced `integrationTest` source set with plan repository and YAML processing end-to-end tests

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Regex pattern parsing, HTTP utilities, caching, rate limiting, and fast mode data generation

## Code Quality

- **Zero Compiler Warnings**: Resolved unreachable code and type erasure warnings in both `app` and `api` modules

- **API Improvements**: Added `enableFastGeneration` configuration flag

## Build & Deployment

- **Gradle 9.1.0**: Updated wrapper version with dedicated integration and performance test tasks

- **Multi-Stage Dockerfile**: Optimized build with Alpine-based runtime for smaller images. [Docs](../../docs/deployment.md)

- **CI/CD**: Updated GitHub Actions workflow for automated performance testing and benchmark tracking

## Documentation

- **Regex Patterns Guide**: Comprehensive documentation with standard vs fast mode comparison, supported patterns, performance benchmarks, and configuration examples. [Docs](../../docs/generator/data-generator.md#regex-patterns)

- **Deployment Guide**: Enhanced Docker documentation with multi-stage build examples. [Docs](../../docs/deployment.md)
