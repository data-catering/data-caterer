# 0.16.10

Deployed: 09-10-2025

Latest features and fixes for Data Catering include:

## YAML Plan and Task Execution via UI/API

- **Automatic YAML Plan Discovery**: UI/API can now execute YAML-defined plans and tasks seamlessly
    - When UI sends a plan with only task summaries, system automatically discovers and loads full YAML plan by name
    - Searches configured plan directory for matching YAML files
    - Supports mixing UI-created plans with YAML-defined tasks
    - [Check here for documentation](../../docs/api.md#yaml-plans-and-connection-configuration)

- **Connection Configuration Auto-Merge**: Connection details from `application.conf` automatically merge with task configurations
    - Connection format (e.g., `json`, `postgres`, `kafka`) derived from top-level configuration key
    - Eliminates duplication of connection details across task files
    - Step-specific options override connection defaults (proper precedence)
    - [Check here for documentation](../../docs/connection.md#automatic-connection-merging-with-yaml-plans)

## Core Engine Improvements

- **PlanProcessor**:
    - Add intelligent YAML plan detection when task definitions are missing from UI requests
    - Implement `findYamlPlanFile()` to locate YAML plans by name in configured directory
    - Create `YamlPlanRun` class to properly merge connection configs into task step options

- **ConnectionRepository**:
    - Add support for loading connections from both saved files and `application.conf`
    - Implement `getConnectionFromConfig()` and `getConnectionsFromConfig()` methods
    - Connection details automatically available to both UI and YAML plans

- **PlanRepository**:
    - Add support for listing and loading YAML plans alongside UI-created plans
    - YAML plan discovery from configured plan directory
    - Seamless integration of YAML and UI plan workflows

## Bug Fixes

- **Connection Configuration Loading**: Fixed "No format specified for data source" error
    - Root cause: Connection configs from `application.conf` were not merged into step options
    - Solution: YamlPlanRun now explicitly merges connection configuration into each task's step options
    - Ensures `format` field and other connection properties are available during execution

## Documentation

- **API Documentation**:
    - Add comprehensive "YAML Plans and Connection Configuration" section
    - Include example workflow showing connection definition, YAML tasks, and plan execution
    - Document benefits: reduced duplication, centralized config, seamless integration

- **Connection Documentation**:
    - Add "Automatic Connection Merging with YAML Plans" section
    - Explain connection format detection, merge precedence, and override behavior
    - Include complete example with `application.conf`, YAML task, and YAML plan

## Tests

- **YamlPlanIntegrationTest**: New comprehensive integration test for YAML plan execution
    - Test YAML plan discovery and loading
    - Test connection configuration merging
    - Verify UI can execute YAML plans seamlessly

- **Test Fixes**:
    - Update DataGeneratorProcessorTest to use correct connection config keys
    - Make YamlPlanIntegrationTest more robust to handle test file variations

## Benefits

- **Reduced Duplication**: Define connection details once in `application.conf`, reuse across all tasks
- **Centralized Configuration**: Manage all connection credentials and settings in one place
- **Seamless Integration**: Mix and match UI-created plans with YAML-defined tasks and configurations
- **Environment Flexibility**: Override connection settings using environment variables without changing task files
- **Better Separation**: Keep connection credentials separate from task definitions for improved security
