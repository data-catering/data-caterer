# 0.16.9

Deployed: 29-09-2025

Latest feature and fixes for Data Catering include:

- Add pre and post processor script support for Docker deployments
    - [Check here for documentation](../../docs/deployment.md#docker-pre-and-post-processing-scripts)
- Environment variables: `PRE_PROCESSOR_SCRIPT`, `POST_PROCESSOR_SCRIPT`, `POST_PROCESSOR_CONDITION`
- `POST_PROCESSOR_CONDITION` supports 'success', 'failure', 'always' execution modes
- Scripts run with proper error handling and logging
- Pre-processor failure stops execution; post-processor failure preserves original Data Caterer exit code
