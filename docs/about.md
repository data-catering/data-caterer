# About

Hi, my name is Peter. I am a Software Developer, mainly focussing on data related services. My experience
can be found on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-flook/).

I have created Data Caterer to help serve individuals and companies with data generation and data testing. It is a
complex area that has many edge cases or intricacies that are hard to summarise or turn into something actionable and
repeatable. Through the use of metadata, Data Caterer can help simplify your data testing, simulating production
environment data, aid in data debugging, or whatever your data use case may be.

Given that it is going to save you and your team time and money, please help in considering financial support. This will
help the product grow into a sustainable and feature-full service.
